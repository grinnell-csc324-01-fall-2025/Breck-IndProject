Observation Activity:
  I had my friend play a game of chess on chess.com and observed how he reacted and act during the game.
  It was a intermedieate bot rated at about 1000 which would be difficult for him as he has never played
  chess competitively before. 

Interview Script:
  I start off by asking how much chess have they played before and if they have a rating.
  If so I ask what it is and how long they have played.
  Then I move onto how they play chess, is it using apps or is it using a real chessboard with friends and family.
  From there I move on to asking if they've ever trained to get better at chess and if so what tools did they use.
  Next, we move to what difficulties they have when it comes to training and getting better, where do they find the most
  trouble when it comes to improving.
  Lastly, I ask them about AI and if they've ever thought about how it could help train you in chess and if
  they thought it could be useful. I also ask them if how much they use AI and if they're familiar with how AI learns.

Notes:

  Observation:
    Brandon told me at the beginning that he knew how the peices moved, but not how to play chess. 
    It was clear from the start because I watched as he moved every other pawn forward 2 spaces as his first few moves.
    He wasn't playing a difficult AI, however it definitely could play chess better than him. At first he was frustrated by his lack of
    knowledge on what to do after the first few moves he made and the AI began to develop the board. At first he panicked and began bring out what 
    he described as his heavy hitters of the knights and bishops. He couldn't tell the difference between the king and queen at first either.
    The game went mostly smooth as they basically traded pawns or other pieces. I could tell he started understanding how to think a out a move in
    advance and understasd the consequences of some moves as he pointed out obvious traps the AI set. Although he was getting the hang of it,
    the AI was better and eventually they reached a point where he only had a few pieces left while the AI had the upper hand. He tried to 
    do a few ideas, but it ended with him losing and resigning.
    I asked him the interview questions after and his responses along with the others are below

  Interviews:
    All of the people I interviewed had played chess before, but not competitively or had an ELO that they knew of off the top of their head.
    None of them could give an exact time of how long they've known how to play and they all said they learned around middle school age so a few
    years.
    Two of them said they only learned from their family on real chess boards while one of them picked it up and played online for a while using chess.com
    They all answered that they never really tried to train in chess or use any tools to get better at chess.
    The general answers I got for difficulties were that they never really knew where to start in order to get better. They just played for fun or
    thought that the more they played the better they would get. It came down to the fact that they didn't have a great fundamental grasp of what you need to be
    good at in chess in order to be better at chess.
    They are all familiar with AI, whether in class or outside of class, they have all used it in one way or another. One of them thought that AI was
    a good idea for chess especially if it cam with feedback and a way to adapt to your skill level. Brandon specifically was confused because he though he just played an AI, which he did, but I explained how mine would be slightly different and he understood.
