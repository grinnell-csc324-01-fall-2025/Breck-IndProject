Starting with the core problem of current chess AI being too complex for learners and teachers, the mind mapping session revealed interconnected solution areas. The main branches explored explanation systems (converting numerical evaluations to natural language like "this move improves your king safety"), visual communication methods (heat maps showing piece influence, animated tactical themes), and adaptive difficulty scaling that grows with user understanding. Secondary branches uncovered teaching integration opportunities, and progress analytics that track conceptual learning rather than just rating improvement.


The SCAMPER technique systematically transformed conventional chess AI through seven prompts, generating innovative approaches to neural network design. Substitute traditional numerical evaluations with storytelling explanations and replace static analysis with conversational dialogue. Combine chess instruction with gamification elements, merge multiple AI personalities (coach, sparring partner, analyst), and integrate social features for shared learning. Adapt techniques from language learning apps like Duolingo's progressive difficulty and streak systems, and borrow from video game tutorials that introduce complex mechanics gradually. Modify the traditional single-move suggestion to offer multiple good options with explanations, and transform the standard analysis interface into an interactive learning environment.
