Task 1: Initial Understanding
What do you think each bot will prioritize based on its name?
  Answered as expected, each bots name gives hints as the the kind of play that they will prioritize.

Which bot sounds most strategic to you? Why?
  CenterControlBot because random can be good or bad, but CaptureBot could put their pieces in bad spots while going for captures so it seems like center control coould be smarter.

How would you explain the difference between these bots to a friend?"
  One bot does random moves and doesn't have a strategy, one of them is super aggressive while the last one would probably be a bit more strategic compared to the others.


Task 2: Observing Bot Behavior
RandomBot vs RandomBot (watch for 3 moves)

CaptureBot vs RandomBot (watch for 3 moves)

CenterControlBot vs RandomBot (watch for 3 moves)

As you watch, tell me:

What differences do you notice immediately?
  The random one really doesn't play the same in either game, it looks like it knows what its doing at first and then it doesn't, kind of like a person who isn't that good at chess.

Are the bots behaving as their names suggest?
  They definetly look like they are.

Can you point to a specific move that shows each bot's strategy?"
  The center bot moves its middle pawns always.


Task 3: Strategic Comparison
What would you say is CaptureBot's main goal?
  To take as many pieces as possible while not losing all of its own.

What advantage does CenterControlBot create for itself?
  It createsa kind of defense in the middle where it can dictate the game.

When would you recommend using RandomBot's strategy vs the others?"
  There is no strategy, but it is very similar to how a lot of people who don't know chess play the game.


Task 4: Name-Function Matching Test
'Moved a pawn to capture an opponent's piece when a non-capturing move was available'
  The CaptureBot definetly did that one, but the other two could as well if they decided it was the move they wanted.

'Moved a knight to the center of the board instead of toward the edge'
  Center or random but probably center considering what I saw the random bot do.

'Moved a piece randomly with no obvious pattern'
  RandomBot obviously.

How confident were you in your answers?"
  Pretty confident, there are possibilities that the other bots could do those moves but the ones I answered with are the most likely ones.

Takeaways:
  RandomBot can be both a really good bot and a really bad bot, this reflects how humans play the game though and could be useful as a trainer for new players to make them think.

  There should be more bots with more complex styles of play.

  The bots work well and even without the names, people would be able to understand their strategy while playing them. This could be good or bad as then the player could exploit the 
  weakness in certain bots to beat them easier.
