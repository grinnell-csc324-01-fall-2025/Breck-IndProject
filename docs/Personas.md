Persona 1: Riley "The Eager Learner"
Age: 16 | Rating: ~800 ELO | Experience: 8 months
Riley is a motivated high school student who discovered chess through "The Queen's Gambit" and practices 45-60 minutes daily on Chess.com. As a Gen Z he's comfortable with technology and prefers mobile-first, visual learning experiences with instant gratification. Riley's primary goal is reaching 1200 ELO within 6 months to compete in tournaments, driven by peer recognition and the desire to beat their older sibling who taught them the basics.

Riley's biggest frustration is the gap between current AI tools and their understanding level. He feels overwhelmed by complex engine evaluations and multi-move variations that don't explain why certain moves are best. They need explainable AI that can provide simple explanations, adapt to their skill level, help identify patterns, prevent common mistakes, and offer encouraging feedback. Riley represents users who want to understand chess deeply but get discouraged by tools designed for expert-level analysis.
