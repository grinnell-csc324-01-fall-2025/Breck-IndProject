# Breck-IndProject

About: This project is about creating a neural network that will be trained on professional chess games in order to be able to beat an average chess player.
        The end goal being a quickly trained AI that has the ability to understand and play chess at a decently high level.
        It is not expected to be the best nor beat the best opponents, but instead hold its own and beat average to higher skilled players.
        I will be importing chess game files and then creating functions using python that can turn the data into understandable matrix's for the neural network to train on.

        The code will exist in VSCode and is coded entirely on the language python.
