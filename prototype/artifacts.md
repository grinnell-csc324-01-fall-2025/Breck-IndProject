Start:
  Does this setup of a chess board look familiar?
    Yes it does, I know what a chess board looks like.

  How do you feel about AI helping you in chess?
    I think it could be helpful given the data.

  Are you able to take critical feedback or do you prefer more lighthearted?
    I like both but in chess, I don't want to be told I'm doing bad, more corrected and guided to the better move.

  Make a few moves and I will be giving you a feedback card, tell me what you think.
    The good move card made me feel like I'm on the right path which is nice but it doesn't do anything else.
    I like how it says I did good and gives advice for my next move.
    The bad feedback was kind of funny, I would prefer to know why its bad.

  How do you feel about pre or post move advice?
    I like post because it allows me to make the decision and still learn while pre feels more like I'm getting told what to do and I'm not getting much better at chess itself.
